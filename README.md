# Meal_Website

⚠️ Site en construction / Website in maintenance

🍔 This is a fictive website for a fast food restaurant, to train and improve myself with Bootstrap and database. I am studying on Skilleos and try to adapt the database course with Node.js (the course is in PhP).

✏️ I am using Node.js and Express.js to create the API.

💻 I am using DBeaver to create the database.
